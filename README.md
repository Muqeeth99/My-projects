# This project was a classification problem in Machine learning. 
# I took a dataset contaning various features of different mobiles and applied different ML algorithms to identify which model best fits to the dataset
# The various algorithms applied are: KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM.
# It was found that Logistic Regression gave the best precision and was best suited to this problem.
